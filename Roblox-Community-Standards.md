- Any political content that violates Roblox's commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful environment.

# Integrity

We want Robloxians to trust each other to play fairly and honestly, and to respect one another's creativity and hard work. To encourage this, Roblox requires its users to follow their local laws and prohibits or limits:

## Cheating and Scams

We do not permit users to deploy or discuss deceptive schemes or methods of cheating on our platform, including:

- Using exploits to gain an unfair advantage anywhere on the platform
- Sharing exploits with others or encouraging others to cheat
- Selling items with misleading or inaccurate descriptions
- Misrepresenting your real or virtual world identity in an effort to mislead others
- Attempting to access another user's account without their authorization
- Posting misleading links for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to others' accounts or information, either on Roblox or elsewhere (i.e., phishing)

## Spam

Roblox prohibits disrupting or misleading others on the platform. This includes:

- Deceptive, sensational, or otherwise misleading content or metadata used to inappropriately drive discoverability or engagement
- Repetitive messaging to other users or uploads to Roblox systems
- Creating experiences solely to direct users off Roblox

## Intellectual Property Violations

We expect you to respect the intellectual property rights of others, and will remove infringing content upon receiving a valid copyright or trademark takedown request from a rights holder. Examples of intellectual property infringement may include:

- Using another developer's code to create your experience without their permission
- Using another artist's media in your experience without their permission
- Using a brand's logo or designs for the content you create without their permission

For information on how to use Roblox's name and logo, please see our Community Usage Guidelines.

Copyright and registered trademark takedown requests can be filed here. Roblox may proactively delete or archive assets if we suspect that the content may be infringing on someone's intellectual property rights.

You can learn more about intellectual property reporting on Roblox here.

# Advertising

## Independent Advertisement Publishing

Instead of using Roblox Immersive Ads, developers may independently publish advertising content in their experience(s). In these cases, the developer of the experience must directly upload and control delivery of the advertising content and remains responsible for such content. When independently publishing advertisements, developers must follow the rules outlined below, as well as all Roblox rules (including the Terms of Use, Advertising Standards, and all other Community Standards) and applicable laws and regulations. If your advertising content violates these rules, we may take action including removing the content, suspending the experience or suspending the account.

- Developers must maintain full control of independent advertisement publishing. If a developer shows independent ads in their experience, that experience may not make programmatic calls to third-party advertising services.
- Developers may not share personally identifiable user engagement information with advertisers and must comply with the Creator Analytics Terms of Use and Roblox Terms of Use in their treatment of all user information.
- Developers are prohibited from showing advertising content to users under the age of 13. To accomplish this, developers must use Roblox tools such as the AreAdsAllowed boolean in PolicyService API to replace, hide, or block access to advertising content to any users who are disallowed from seeing ads.

Note: Applying a 13+ Experience Guideline does not hide ad content from users under the age of 13. All ad content must be hidden using the PolicyService API.

- Developers must clearly and prominently disclose to users when content is an advertisement using simple and understandable language. Reference to the name of an advertiser alone is insufficient. Examples of acceptable disclosure language include "ad," "paid," or "sponsored." The disclosure should be in or near the advertising content and be presented in a way that is likely to be noticed and understood by users.
- Developers may not mislead users into thinking that they are engaging with Roblox served Ads.
- Developers may not reuse or repurpose Roblox Immersive Ad content.
- Advertisements cannot falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offer free Robux).

For more information on how to independently advertise, please see our Creator guidance here.

## Prohibited Advertising Practices and Content

All advertisements on Roblox must adhere to Roblox's Advertising Standards. Creator guidance for complying with the Advertising Standards can be found here.

# Roblox Economy

Roblox maintains the Robux system for everyone's benefit and enjoyment. To keep it fair for everyone, some activity in the Roblox Economy is prohibited, including:

- Using third-party services to buy, sell, trade, or give away Robux. This does not apply to Roblox gift cards.
- Engaging in off-platform, secondary market transactions for account access or virtual content from experiences or Marketplace. This does not apply to account holders selling or transferring the rights to the account's creations as part of a verifiable agreement.
- Using the group payout system in a fraudulent or misleading manner; including offering payment in Robux for acting as a model for assets, joining groups, referring members, or role-playing in experiences.
- Circumventing Roblox payment systems or fees, including by providing users indirect benefits for purchasing content or packages in other Roblox properties or systems.

## Promotional Offers

Developers may not use off-platform services or products to sell on-platform items (including exclusive features or other in-experience enhancements) for money or Robux, either directly or as a bundle, unless expressly authorized by or in partnership with Roblox. Find more details on acceptable promo codes here.

## Soliciting Donations

We also do not allow our community to solicit donations for a charitable cause on Roblox, including:

- In-experience prompts for users to donate Robux toward a crowdfunding campaign
- Claiming that a transaction is associated with a fundraiser
- Stating to users that some amount of sales proceeds will be directed toward a cause

Note: Developers may implement in-experience Robux transactions for users to express appreciation of the experience or generously reward a creator (e.g. a "tip jar" feature) as long as it is clear to the user that they receive nothing in return for their payment.

## Paid Random Items

Paid random item generators include those purchased with Robux directly or via in-experience currencies that are purchased with Robux.

- If paid random items are available in your experience, users may not trade or sell the resulting assets for Robux, real currency, or anything else of value on Roblox.
- Creators must use the applicable PolicyService API to ensure paid random items are only accessible by eligible users.
- The odds of receiving each possible resulting item must be accurately disclosed to the eligible user before the moment of purchase.

# Security

For our community to thrive, everyone must feel digitally safe as well as physically safe. We can achieve this by respecting each other's personal information and Roblox's safety systems, and by keeping Roblox accounts secure. This section describes how players and creators should treat others' information and protect their own and others' digital security.

For information about how Roblox handles your personal information, please visit the Privacy Policy. For more information on how to keep your account secure - including how to enable additional security features such as two-step verification - visit our help page here.

To help maintain a safe metaverse, Roblox does not permit:

- Email address
- Passwords or access tokens
